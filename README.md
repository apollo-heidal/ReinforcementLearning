# ReinforcementLearning
Currently, this contains independent Python implementations of the problem described in Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd ed.) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (ISBN: 978-0-262-19398-6). I have done my best to code the implementations using only the pseudocode given for various methods in the book.
